And in some places, the air quality warnings include the warning to stay inside. We wanted to better understand what's happening here and why, so we called Peter Decarlo, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. Good morning, professor.",

The season has been pretty dry already, and then the fact that we're getting hit in the US. Is because there's a couple of weather systems that are essentially channeling the smoke from those Canadian wildfires through Pennsylvania into the Mid Atlantic and the Northeast and kind of just dropping the smoke there.",
